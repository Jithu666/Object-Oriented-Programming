    What is Method Signature ?

    Method Signature is the combination of method name followed by the argument type.

    ex: public void add(double a, double b){

    }

    Here add (double, double) is the method signature.

    Compiler stores a method table to check whether the calling function exists in the method table, if the method exists then compiler checks whether the function accepts the type of arguments passed to the function are available in the calling function.

    if the method exists and the argument type matches then the compiler will call the function. or else COmpile time error will be thrown.
