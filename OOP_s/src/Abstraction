    hiding the implementation details and showing only the services and operations which can be performed to the end-user is called as abstraction.

    this is done to keep our implementation details confidential from the end-users.


    Hiding internal details, by highlighting the set of operations we are going to provide.

    by using interfaces, we can implement Abstraction.


    Advantages of Abstraction:

    Security
    Outsiders will not know the internal working details
    Enhancement will become easy, without affecting the end-user.
    maintainability of the Application will improved

    by using interfaces Modularity of the code can be enhanced. which will lead to code readability.
