                        // Inheritance

    1. Inheritance is also called as `is a Relationship`
    2. The main Advantage is Code Re-Usability
    3. Inheritance is implemented by using `extends` keyword


        // Object class acts as the root for all java classes.

        Object has built-in classes like String, StringBuffer, Math, Number, Throwable, etc...

        Which class acts as the root for java exception hierarchy

        Throwable ...

        Throwable class holds all the common classes and methods for Java Exception and Error hierarchy.



                        // Advantages of Inheritance

    1. Code Re-Usability
    2. Reduces Code Duplication



    Types of Inheritance.

    1. Single Level Inheritance
    When a Single child class is derived from a single parent class, then such a Inheritance is called as Single Level inheritance

    class A {

    }

    class B extends A {

    }


    2. Multiple Inheritance

     When a single class inherit properties from multiple parent classes, then such type of a inheritance is called as Multiple Inheritance.

     Java does not support multiple Inheritance.

     To implement Multiple Inheritance in java, we need to use Interfaces.

        Why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance?

        because, it might lead to Ambiguity or Diamond problem.

        This Problem can be solved using Interfaces, How ?

        In Interfaces, we declare the Interfaces, which is just declared, when a class needs to implement a interface it is should be done by a sub-class, so even if the `Interface` is been declared multiple times, but it is `implemented` only once through the sub-class, so there does not exists the problem of Ambiguity and Diamond-problem.


     class A{                                               Interface A{

     }                                                      }

     class B{                                               Interface B {

    }                                                       }

     class c extends class A, B {                           Interface C extends A, B {

     } // Multiple Inheritance not supported by java        }


     all classes directly extends Object class. Only if the class is does not already extends any other class. Hence Java Strictly does not support Multiple Inheritance


     3. Multi-Level Inheritance

        When a child class acts as a parent class for another class, then such a Inheritance is called as Multi-Level Inheritance.

        class A{

        }

        class B extends A{

        }

        class C extends B {

        }


        4. Hierarchical Inheritance

        When more than One child class inherit properties from One Single class, then such a type of Inheritance is called as Hierarchical Inheritance.

        class A{

        }

        class B extends A {

        }

        class C extends A{

        }


        5. Hybrid Inheritance

        when there exists more than one type of Inheritance, such a Inheritance is called as Hybrid Inheritance.
