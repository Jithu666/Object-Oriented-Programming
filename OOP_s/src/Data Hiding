    // Data Hiding is the process of hiding the variables from being accessed by un-authorised people from outside the class,

    main advantage of "Data Hiding" is Security

    Data Hiding can be achieved by using private access modifier's in variables.

    other people cannot use the methods which are being declared as `Private`

    if we declare the variables and methods as `Private` then those variables can be accessed only within that particular class, so we cannot access that variables from other class and achieve security

    public class age {

        Private int age = 22;

        Private int getAge(){
            return age;
        }

    }
