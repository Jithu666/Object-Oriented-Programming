// For Compiling we use the Code javac program_name.java

// To run the program we use java program_name.


// JAVA SOURCE FILE STRUCTURE

Java program we can hava any number of classes. But can have "At-most" One Public class.
more than one public class is not allowed in One java program.

the java program should be saved by the name of the public class if public class exists in the program.
otherwise any name can be used to save the java program.

Whenever we compile a java program, for every java class present in the program, a separate .class file will be generated.


we can compile a java file i.e. .java file (java program)

but we can only execute a .class file, .class file which is been created after compilation.
